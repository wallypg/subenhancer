OCR Scripts

The OCR Scripts are nothing but a serie of Find-ReplaceBy specifications in a human-friendly close to HTML syntax. What makes them powerful?. The commands that are available. The possibility of using regular expression makes possible for you to find and replace almost anything needed in any language. A very important thing to know about OCR Scripts is that all commands are performed consecutively, that is, in the order they are written. 
Let's now see a small example of an OCR Script:
<SWOCR WordChars="0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_ñÑáéíóúÁÉÍÓÚäëïöü">
	<!-- The comments are set just like in HTML -->
	<ERROR Find="[A-ZÁ-Ú](l)" ReplaceBy="I">
	<ERROR Find="[a-zá-ú](I)" ReplaceBy="l">
	<ERROR Find="\d( :)" ReplaceBy=":">
	<ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="False" Find=",{2,}" ReplaceBy="...">
</SWOCR>
WordChars represents all the charcters that can form a word in your language. The default is the string shown above. If no parameter is passed, the default will be used. This are one of the most common OCR errors in English language, as in OCR Engines, "l" (small "L") and "I" (big "i") have no difference at all, they are often misplaced. Another very common error is the inclussion of spaces before colon. In the short example above Subtitle Workshop will use regular expressions on the search for errors. And if we don't want to use regular expressions?. For that we need to take a look at the parameters that define how you want the search to be made:

UseRE
UseRE="True" or UseRE="False". The default value is True. If it is set to false then regular expressions will not be used in the search. Use it as False only if you want to simplify the way find-replace commands are written, because if regular expressions are disabled then the OCR scripts have few power. 

UseREOnlyToFind
UseREOnlyToFind="True" or UseREOnlyToFind="False". The default value is True. To explain how this works we need to see an example:
<ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="True" Find="[a-z]at" ReplaceBy="dog">
Applied to "The name of my cat is Max" will return "The name of my dog is Max", but
<ERROR UseREOnlyToFind="False" Find="[a-z](at)" ReplaceBy="dog">
Applied to "The name of my cat is Max" will return "The name of my cdog is Max".

In the first situation, when we are about to replace we also replace the part that is a regular expression (in this case "[a-z]", matching "c" this time).
In the second situation, when we are about to replace we only use the regular expression part ("[a-z]") to search for the text, but we don't use it to replace. We will only replace the part o the "Find=" text that is between parenthesis, that is, you need to write the normal regular expression and the part that is "constant" and won't vary between parenthesis. This is extremely useful for the OCR Scripts (take a deep look at Default.ocr to understand). 

The following parameters are only available when "UseRE" is set to false:

WholeWord
WholeWord="True" or WholeWord="False". Setting it to False is the same as not including it. If true, it will find the "Find=" text only if it is forming a Word. 

CaseSensitive
CaseSensitive="True" or CaseSensitive="False". Setting it to False is the same as not including it. If true, it will be case sensitive while finding the text. 

This are the most used commands, you can do a lot with them. But there are more:

PreserveCase
The default value is False. If true, it will preserve the case of "Find" text when replacing to "ReplaceBy" text. For example, if we have this error:
<ERROR UseRE="False" Find="DOG" WholeWord="True" PreserveCase="True" ReplaceBy="CAT">
As it is not case sensitive, we suppose Subtitle Workshop finds the text "Dog" and not "DOG". When replacing to "CAT", it will clone the case of the text it found, so it will replace "Dog" by "Cat" and not by "CAT". 

Syntax of Regular Expressions

Introduction

This document is taken from TRegExpr help file, an excellent Regular Expressions library for Delphi, by Andrey V. Sorokin. 

Regular Expressions are a widely-used method of specifying patterns of text to search for. Special metacharacters allow You to specify, for instance, that a particular string You are looking for occurs at the beginning or end of a line, or contains n recurrences of a certain character.
Regular expressions look ugly for novices, but really they are very simple (well, usually simple ;) ), handly and powerfull tool. 

I strongly recommend you to play with regular expressions. Let's start our learning trip! 

Simple matches

Any single character matches itself, unless it is a metacharacter with a special meaning described below.

A series of characters matches that series of characters in the target string, so the pattern "bluh" would match "bluh" in the target string. Quite simple, eh?

You can cause characters that normally function as metacharacters or escape sequences to be interpreted literally by 'escaping' them by preceding them with a backslash "\", for instance: metacharacter "^" match beginning of string, but "\^" match character "^", "\\" match "\" and so on.

Examples:
foobar	matchs string 'foobar'
\^FooBarPtr	matchs '^FooBarPtr'
Escape sequences

Characters may be specified using a escape sequences syntax much like that used in C and Perl: "\n'' matches a newline, "\t'' a tab, etc. More generally, \xnn, where nn is a string of hexadecimal digits, matches the character whose ASCII value is nn. If You need wide (Unicode) character code, You can use '\x{nnnn}', where 'nnnn' - one or more hexadecimal digits.

\xnn	char with hex code nn
\x{nnnn}	char with hex code nnnn (one byte for plain text and two bytes for Unicode)
\t	tab (HT/TAB), same as \x09
\n	newline (NL), same as \x0a
\r	car.return (CR), same as \x0d
\f	form feed (FF), same as \x0c
\a	alarm (bell) (BEL), same as \x07
\e	escape (ESC), same as \x1b

Examples:
foo\x20bar	matchs 'foo bar' (note space in the middle)
\tfoobar	matchs 'foobar' predefined by tab

Character classes

You can specify a character class, by enclosing a list of characters in [], which will match any one character from the list. 

If the first character after the "['' is "^'', the class matches any character not in the list. 

Examples:
foob[aeiou]r	finds strings 'foobar', 'foober' etc. but not 'foobbr', 'foobcr' etc.
foob[^aeiou]r	find strings 'foobbr', 'foobcr' etc. but not 'foobar', 'foober' etc.

Within a list, the "-'' character is used to specify a range, so that a-z represents all characters between "a'' and "z'', inclusive.

If you want "-'' itself to be a member of a class, put it at the start or end of the list, or escape it with a backslash. If you want ']' you may place it at the start of list or escape it with a backslash. 

Examples:
[-az]	matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
[az-]	matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
[a\-z]	matchs 'a', 'z' and '-'
[a-z]	matchs all twenty six small characters from 'a' to 'z'
[\n-\x0D]	matchs any of #10,#11,#12,#13.
[\d-t]	matchs any digit, '-' or 't'.
[]-a]	matchs any char from ']'..'a'.

Metacharacters

Metacharacters are special characters which are the essence of Regular Expressions. There are different types of metacharacters, described below. 

Metacharacters - line separators
^	start of line
$	end of line
\A	start of text
\Z	end of text
.	any character in line

Examples:
^foobar	matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the beginning of line
foobar$	matchs string 'foobar' only if it's at the end of line
^foobar$	matchs string 'foobar' only if it's the only string in line
foob.r	matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobbr', 'foob1r' and so on

The "^" metacharacter by default is only guaranteed to match at the beginning of the input string/text, the "$" metacharacter only at the end. Embedded line separators will not be matched by "^'' or "$''.
You may, however, wish to treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such that the "^'' will match after any line separator within the string, and "$'' will match before any line separator. You can do this by switching On the modifier /m.
The \A and \Z are just like "^'' and "$'', except that they won't match multiple times when the modifier /m is used, while "^'' and "$'' will match at every internal line separator.

The ".'' metacharacter by default matches any character, but if You switch Off the modifier /s, then '.' won't match embedded line separators.

TRegExpr works with line separators as recommended at www.unicode.org (http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr18/):

"^" is at the beginning of a input string, and, if modifier /m is On, also immediately following any occurrence of \x0D\x0A or \x0A or \x0D (if You are using Unicode version of TRegExpr, then also \x2028 or \x2029 or \x0B or \x0C or \x85). Note that there is no empty line within the sequence \x0D\x0A.

"$" is at the end of a input string, and, if modifier /m is On, also immediately preceding any occurrence of \x0D\x0A or \x0A or \x0D (if You are using Unicode version of TRegExpr, then also \x2028 or \x2029 or \x0B or \x0C or \x85). Note that there is no empty line within the sequence \x0D\x0A.

"." matchs any character, but if You switch Off modifier /s then "." doesn't match \x0D\x0A and \x0A and \x0D (if You are using Unicode version of TRegExpr, then also \x2028 and \x2029 and \x0B and \x0C and \x85).

Note that "^.*$" (an empty line pattern) doesnot match the empty string within the sequence \x0D\x0A, but matchs the empty string within the sequence \x0A\x0D.

Multiline processing can be easely tuned for Your own purpose with help of TRegExpr properties LineSeparators and LinePairedSeparator, You can use only Unix style separators \n or only DOS/Windows style \r\n or mix them together (as described above and used by default) or define Your own line separators!

Metacharacters - predefined classes

\w	an alphanumeric character (including "_")
\W	a nonalphanumeric
\d	a numeric character
\D	a non-numeric
\s	any space (same as [ \t\n\r\f])
\S	a non space

You may use \w, \d and \s within custom character classes.

Examples:
foob\dr	matchs strings like 'foob1r', ''foob6r' and so on but not 'foobar', 'foobbr' and so on
foob[\w\s]r	matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foob r', 'foobbr' and so on but not 'foob1r', 'foob=r' and so on

TRegExpr uses properties SpaceChars and WordChars to define character classes \w, \W, \s, \S, so You can easely redefine it.

Metacharacters - word boundaries

\b	Match a word boundary
\B	Match a non-(word boundary)

A word boundary (\b) is a spot between two characters that has a \w on one side of it and a \W on the other side of it (in either order), counting the imaginary characters off the beginning and end of the string as matching a \W.

Metacharacters - iterators

Any item of a regular expression may be followed by another type of metacharacters - iterators. Using this metacharacters you can specify number of occurences of previous character, metacharacter or subexpression.
*	zero or more ("greedy"), similar to {0,}
+	one or more ("greedy"), similar to {1,}
?	zero or one ("greedy"), similar to {0,1}
{n}	exactly n times ("greedy")
{n,}	at least n times ("greedy")
{n,m}	at least n but not more than m times ("greedy")
*?	zero or more ("non-greedy"), similar to {0,}?
+?	one or more ("non-greedy"), similar to {1,}?
??	zero or one ("non-greedy"), similar to {0,1}?
{n}?	exactly n times ("non-greedy")
{n,}?	at least n times ("non-greedy")
{n,m}?	at least n but not more than m times ("non-greedy")

So, digits in curly brackets of the form {n,m}, specify the minimum number of times to match the item n and the maximum m. The form {n} is equivalent to {n,n} and matches exactly n times. The form {n,} matches n or more times. There is no limit to the size of n or m, but large numbers will chew up more memory and slow down r.e. execution.

If a curly bracket occurs in any other context, it is treated as a regular character.

Examples:
foob.*r	matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobalkjdflkj9r' and 'foobr'
foob.+r	matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobalkjdflkj9r' but not 'foobr'
foob.?r	matchs strings like 'foobar', 'foobbr' and 'foobr' but not 'foobalkj9r'
fooba{2}r	matchs the string 'foobaar'
fooba{2,}r	matchs strings like 'foobaar', 'foobaaar', 'foobaaaar' etc.
fooba{2,3}r	matchs strings like 'foobaar', or 'foobaaar' but not 'foobaaaar'

A little explanation about "greediness". "Greedy" takes as many as possible, "non-greedy" takes as few as possible. For example, 'b+' and 'b*' applied to string 'abbbbc' return 'bbbb', 'b+?' returns 'b', 'b*?' returns empty string, 'b{2,3}?' returns 'bb', 'b{2,3}' returns 'bbb'.

You can switch all iterators into "non-greedy" mode (see the modifier /g).

Metacharacters - alternatives

You can specify a series of alternatives for a pattern using "|'' to separate them, so that fee|fie|foe will match any of "fee'', "fie'', or "foe'' in the target string (as would f(e|i|o)e). The first alternative includes everything from the last pattern delimiter ("('', "['', or the beginning of the pattern) up to the first "|'', and the last alternative contains everything from the last "|'' to the next pattern delimiter. For this reason, it's common practice to include alternatives in parentheses, to minimize confusion about where they start and end.
Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first alternative found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that is chosen. This means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For example: when matching foo|foot against "barefoot'', only the "foo'' part will match, as that is the first alternative tried, and it successfully matches the target string. (This might not seem important, but it is important when you are capturing matched text using parentheses.)
Also remember that "|'' is interpreted as a literal within square brackets, so if You write [fee|fie|foe] You're really only matching [feio|].

Examples:
foo(bar|foo)	matchs strings 'foobar' or 'foofoo'.

Metacharacters - subexpressions

The bracketing construct ( ... ) may also be used for define r.e. subexpressions (after parsing You can find subexpression positions, lengths and actual values in MatchPos, MatchLen and Match properties of TRegExpr, and substitute it in template strings by TRegExpr.Substitute).

Subexpressions are numbered based on the left to right order of their opening parenthesis.
First subexpression has number '1' (whole r.e. match has number '0' - You can substitute it in TRegExpr.Substitute as '$0' or '$&'). 

Examples:
(foobar){8,10}	matchs strings which contain 8, 9 or 10 instances of the 'foobar'
foob([0-9]|a+)r	matchs 'foob0r', 'foob1r' , 'foobar', 'foobaar', 'foobaar' etc.

Metacharacters - backreferences

Metacharacters \1 through \9 are interpreted as backreferences. \<n> matches previously matched subexpression #<n>. 

Examples:
(.)\1+	matchs 'aaaa' and 'cc'.
(.+)\1+	also match 'abab' and '123123'
(['"]?)(\d+)\1	matchs '"13" (in double quotes), or '4' (in single quotes) or 77 (without quotes) etc

Modifiers

Modifiers are for changing behaviour of TRegExpr.

There are many ways to set up modifiers. 
Any of these modifiers may be embedded within the regular expression itself using the (?...) construct.
Also, you can assign to appropriate TRegExpr properties (Modifier for example to change /x, or ModifierStr to change all modifiers together). The default values for new instances of TRegExpr object defined in global variables, for example global variable RegExprModifierX defines value of new TRegExpr instance ModifierX property. 

i	Do case-insensitive pattern matching (using installed in you system locale settings), see also InvertCase.
m	Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change "^'' and "$'' from matching at only the very start or end of the string to the start or end of any line anywhere within the string, see also Line separators.
s	Treat string as single line. That is, change ".'' to match any character whatsoever, even a line separators (see also Line separators), which it normally would not match.
g	Non standard modifier. Switching it Off You'll switch all following operators into non-greedy mode (by default this modifier is On). So, if modifier /g is Off then '+' works as '+?', '*' as '*?' and so on
x	Extend your pattern's legibility by permitting whitespace and comments (see explanation below).
r	Non-standard modifier. If is set then range à-ÿ additional include russian letter '¸', À-ß additional include '¨', and à-ß include all russian symbols. Sorry for foreign users, but it's set by default. If you want switch if off by default - set false to global variable RegExprModifierR.

The modifier /x itself needs a little more explanation. It tells the TRegExpr to ignore whitespace that is neither backslashed nor within a character class. You can use this to break up your regular expression into (slightly) more readable parts. The # character is also treated as a metacharacter introducing a comment, for example:

(
(abc) # comment 1
  |   # You can use spaces to format r.e. - TRegExpr ignores it
(efg) # comment 2
)
This also means that if you want real whitespace or # characters in the pattern (outside a character class, where they are unaffected by /x), that you'll either have to escape them or encode them using octal or hex escapes. Taken together, these features go a long way towards making regular expressions text more readable. 
Perl extensions

(?imsxr-imsxr)
You may use it into r.e. for modifying modifiers by the fly. If this construction inlined into subexpression, then it effects only into this subexpression.

Examples:
(?i)Saint-Petersburg	matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'Saint-Petersburg'
(?i)Saint-(?-i)Petersburg	matchs 'Saint-Petersburg' but not 'Saint-petersburg'
(?i)(Saint-)?Petersburg	matchs 'Saint-petersburg' and 'saint-petersburg'
((?i)Saint-)?Petersburg	matchs 'saint-Petersburg', but not 'saint-petersburg'

(?#text) A comment, the text is ignored. Note that TRegExpr closes the comment as soon as it sees a ")", so there is no way to put a literal ")" in the comment.
